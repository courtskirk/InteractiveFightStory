		<p> It's all been a blur. From being pulled from your home, to the many chemical
				injections, and now you're in a fighting stadium.

		<p>
			You're not alone though, there's a girl there too. You recognize her, she was also one of the chosen.
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			You look over to her trying to start conversation. <span class='bg-green'> Hey do you know what we are doing in here?</span> you ask.
		</pre>
		<pre>
			She doesn't look in your direction. Instead she looks down before saying, <span class='bg-green'>"Fighting I guess." </span>
		</pre>

		<p> An electronic voice comes over an intercome. <span class ='bg-red'> <span class='long-cang'><b> FIGHTERS TO YOUR CORNERS! THE MATCH BEGINS IN 3...2...1..</b> </span> </span>
